I will implement the REST API to:

1. Post new tweet. New tweet will not go beyond 144 characters.
2. Get All tweets (username, date/time of post, tweet message, likes count, replies)
3. Increase the count of likes by one. 
4. I will keep Re-Tweet and more-options links as non-functional.
5. I will be able to reply to my own tweet.
