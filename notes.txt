Spring Boot

Spring Core (AOP, IoC, DI, CCC) -> Spring MVC + Spring REST(lots of configuration!!!! Not Easy!) -> Spring Boot! (auto configuration) -> Spring Cloud (Microservices!!!!)

for what purpose mainly we use spring boot? So in springboot we have all features of spring core and spring mvc included?

is it possible to migrate from spring mvc to spring boot  if the app is on spring mvc?

java core to spring core

REST end points!
